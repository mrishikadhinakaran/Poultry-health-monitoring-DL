# Poultry Health Monitoring with Deep Learning

Welcome to the **Poultry-health-monitoring-DL** project! This repository provides a deep learning-based solution for monitoring the health status of poultry, enabling early detection of diseases and supporting better farm management.

## Overview

This project leverages deep learning techniques to analyze poultry health data—such as images of chickens or their fecal matter—to detect signs of disease, track health trends, and provide actionable insights to farmers and veterinarians. Early and accurate health monitoring can significantly reduce mortality rates, improve productivity, and lower diagnostic costs compared to traditional lab tests[^4][^5][^6].

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:**  
  - Gathers poultry health data, including images and relevant metadata.
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Cleans and prepares data for model training (e.g., image augmentation, normalization).
- **Deep Learning Model:**  
  - Implements state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as MobileNetV2, VGG16, InceptionV3, or custom architectures for disease classification[^4][^5].
- **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
  - Trains models on labeled datasets of healthy and diseased poultry.
  - Evaluates performance using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).
- **Real-time Monitoring (Optional):**  
  - Supports real-time detection and tracking of poultry health status.
- **Visualization & Reporting:**  
  - Provides visual summaries of health trends and model predictions.
- **Deployment (Optional):**  
  - Can be deployed as a web or mobile application for on-farm use.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch** (Deep learning frameworks)
- **OpenCV** (Image processing)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Interactive development)
- **Streamlit / Flask** (Optional, for web deployment)
- **Cloud Platforms** (Optional, for scalable deployment)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```

git clone https://github.com/mrishikadhinakaran/Poultry-health-monitoring-DL.git
cd Poultry-health-monitoring-DL

```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
*(If you don’t have a requirements file, install the packages listed above.)*

3. **Prepare Your Data:**
- Place your poultry health images and metadata in the `data/` directory.
- Update configuration files if necessary.

4. **Train the Model:**
- Run the main training script or Jupyter notebook.
- Monitor training progress and evaluate model performance.

5. **Visualize Results:**
- Use provided scripts to generate visualizations and reports.

6. **Deploy (Optional):**
- Use Streamlit, Flask, or another framework to deploy the model for real-time monitoring.

## Example

Below is a simplified example of how to use the project:

```

import tensorflow as tf
from src.preprocess import preprocess_data
from src.model import train_model

# Load and preprocess data

train_images, train_labels = preprocess_data('data/train/')
test_images, test_labels = preprocess_data('data/test/')

# Train model

model = train_model(train_images, train_labels)
model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
